# D&D 5e Spell Viewer

This directory is a little project I created while learning the basics of Electron.
It's intended to be a simple spell browser, without something to fancy.

## Compiled Project

*Write text here*

## Spells Database

The idea was to be able to use the software offline, so all the spells are stored in a json file.
The file itself is not my own creation, so all credits go to [@jcquinlan](https://github.com/jcquinlan) user.
The original file can be found in [this](https://github.com/jcquinlan/dnd-spells) directory.

## How to use run the project
